# Network-Simulation-Model-Exploring-Packet-Transmission
simulates a basic network environment written in C++. It focuses on understanding packet transmission dynamics, acknowledgments, and packet loss effects.
The simulation models:

Sending "Hello" packets between network nodes.
Packet loss with a configurable probability.
Timeouts and failure logging for lost packets.
Key functionalities:

Event-driven simulation using a priority queue.
Modeling packet sending, acknowledgments, and timeouts.
Simple loss model to simulate network unreliability.
Project goals:

Provide a foundation for understanding network simulations.
Explore how network parameters impact performance.
Serve as a starting point for further network studies.
